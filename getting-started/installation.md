# Installation

* Download the ioMenu package from [CodeCanyon](https://codecanyon.net/downloads). 
* Go to *Plugins > Add New* and click on the "Upload Plugin" button
* Choose the file named *ioMenu.zip* and upload it. Remember, not *ioMenu-v1.x.zip* as you'd have to unzip that file to find *ioMenu.zip* inside it.
* Activate ioMenu. You should see ioMenu visible on your website at this point but the menu it shows might not be correct.
