# Quick Start

This is a tl;dr version of the getting started section for those in a hurry. If you're new, then we recommend starting from the [Requirements](./requirements.md) page instead.

## 1. Installation & Activation

* Go to *Plugins > Add New* and click on the "Upload Plugin" button
* Download the ioMenu package from [CodeCanyon](https://codecanyon.net/downloads).
* Choose the file named *ioMenu.zip* and upload it. Remember, not *ioMenu-v1.x.zip* as you'd have to unzip that file to find *ioMenu.zip* inside it.
* Activate ioMenu
You will see ioMenu visible on your website at this point but the menu it shows might not be correct.

## 2. Creating a Menu

* Go to *Appearance > Menus* and create a new menu or edit an existing menu.
* Scroll down to Menu Settings and select the two Theme Locations added by ioMenu called *ioMenu - Desktop* and *ioMenu - Mobile*
At this point, ioMenu should be visible on your website and should show the correct menu items.


## 3. Integration


#### Automatic Integration
ioMenu integrates with every [well coded theme](./requirements.md). If your theme fulfills these requirements (almost every theme does) you should already be setup as automatic integration is enabled by  default. [Read more.](./integration.md)


#### Manual Integration
Alternatively, you can also disable Automatic Integration and manually place ioMenu's Shortcode or PHP code. [Read more.](./integration.md)


## 4. Menu Configurations

#### Configuration and Styling Options
The global configurations and styling options for ioMenu are in Customizer. Go to *Appearance > Customizer* and choose the ioMenu section.

#### Menu Items and Dropdown Options
Every Menu item has its own set of options for enabling Megamenu, styling, adding icon etc. To edit these go to *Appearance > Menus* and click on any menu item to reveal its options.
