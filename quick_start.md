# Quick Start


## Installation & Activation

* Go to *Plugins > Add New* and click on the "Upload Plugin" button
* Download the ioMenu package from [CodeCanyon](https://codecanyon.net/downloads).
* Choose the file named *ioMenu.zip* and upload it. Remember, not *ioMenu-v1.x.zip* as you'd have to unzip that file to find *ioMenu.zip* inside it.
* Activate ioMenu
You will see ioMenu visible on your website at this point but the menu it shows might not be correct.

## Creating a Menu

* Go to *Appearance > Menus* and create a new menu or edit an existing menu.
* Scroll down to Menu Settings and select the two Theme Locations added by ioMenu called *ioMenu - Desktop* and *ioMenu - Mobile*
At this point, ioMenu should be visible on your website and should show the correct menu items.


## Integration


### Automatic Integration

ioMenu integrates with every [well coded theme](./requirements.md). If your theme fulfills these requirements (almost every theme does) you should already be setup as automatic integration is enabled by  default. [Read more.](./integration.md)


### Manual Integration

Alternatively, you can also disable Automatic Integration and manually place ioMenu's Shortcode or PHP code.
