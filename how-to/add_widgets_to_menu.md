# Add widgets to menu

You can add widgets to any Mega Menu created with ioMenu.

> _Please note that while you can add widgets to Megamenu, they won't be styled by ioMenu as its not the primary focus of ioMenu. We however have an addon which is being offered for free on our _[_Demo Page_](https://www.themeshop.io/demo/menu/)_ if you signup for our newsletter._



1. Go to Appearance &gt; Widgets
2. Drag and drop any widget from the available widgets to "ioMenu Widgets Container". The widget in "ioMenu Widgets Container" widget area can be added to the menu. ![](/assets/ioMenu-widgets-container.png)
